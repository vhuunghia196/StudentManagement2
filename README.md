# 🔥 Student Management 🔥 
-   Welcome to the Student Management project with Python Flask! This project aims to create a flexible and powerful web application that enables teachers to manage student information, grades, and various aspects related to classroom management. With this application, teachers can easily view the list of courses they are teaching. They can enter grades for each student in their courses, thereby generating detailed grade sheets and overall grade statistics. Furthermore, the application also allows teachers to perform class management activities, including changing classes for students, updating information for the current semester, and managing past semesters.💝
-   This project utilizes the Flask framework in Python to build the web application, providing flexibility and scalability. The user interface is constructed using HTML, CSS, and incorporates JavaScript libraries such as JQuery to interact with data and enhance user experience.💝
-   With this Student Management project, teachers can easily manage essential aspects of teaching and classroom administration. Explore and enjoy the flexibility and convenience of this application to enhance your teaching management experience! 💝
